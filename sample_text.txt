Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.

Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. A global community of programmers maintains and develops CPython, an open source reference implementation of Python.

The Python Package Index (PyPI) is a repository of software for the Python programming language containing more than 300,000 packages with a range of functionality.
